basic basic for now.

I decided to get a max/msp license because of gen~ and jsui. The goal is to make a tracker interface that will turn max/msp into a playground where i can make and trigger synths exactly the way i want, and hook them up in a modular way to effects. Rather than moaning about the things that i percieve as limitations in other tools/trackers. My main issue is that i want to be able to control the creative part entirely via a keyboard, or via a scripting interface, if i want to. 

Some milestones i will need to tackle, in no particular order

- [x] handleing keyboard qwerty input
- [ ] loading existing patterns
- [ ] sequencing patterns
- [x] displaying patterns
- [x] displaying current tick location
- [x] cursor + navigation
- [ ] selection rectangle
- [ ] input error handling
- [ ] interpolation
- [ ] util functions(hex to int, etc)
- [x] note to midinote
